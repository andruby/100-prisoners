Simulation of the 100 Prisoners Riddle

See [Veritasium's video](https://youtu.be/iSNsgj1OCLA)

I wanted to run the simulation to check the results.

## How to run

```shell
ruby random.rb # limited to 10 prisoners (see code comments)
ruby chain.rb # runs for 100 prisoners
```

And compare the results. :)
